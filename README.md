# Battleship ⛴️

Welcome to the repository for the best local battleship game ever made! This was created as part of Software Engineering II at the
University of Kansas by Team 15: The BKFL Corp. 🥬

# How To Play

The only requirement to play is to have version 3.11.5 or higher of the [Python programming language](https://python.org/). Older versions
may work, but they are currently unsupported. To start the game, simply run the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```

From there pass the computer back and forth between players, following the prompts on screen. The screen will clear between turns, and
each player will have a password to input between turns to ensure no cheating takes place. 😈

Happy gaming! 👾🍻
